# Framework-Standards
California State Framework and Standards for History

Located in the File Dump folder are the following 4 documents:
  Framework for 7th Grade
  Framework for 8th Grade
  Instructional Practices
  Standards

Unless the great state of California decides to make major changes to either the Framework or Standards, this REPO will not be updated.
